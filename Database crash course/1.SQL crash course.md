# DATA
+ Data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information.

+ Mostly data represents recordable facts. Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts.
---

![bg width:1000px](./db2.png)

---
# What is Database?
+ Collection of data.
+ Any collection of related information

+ To operate a large amount of information
+ To store, retrieve and manage data in the form of tables, reports, etc.
 
---
![bg width:1200px](./db1.jpg)

 # DBMS(Data Base Management System)

+ A special software program for creating and maintaining database.
+ DBMS stores the data in the form of files .
+ Manages various operations like 
-- Database creation
--Storing data in database
--updating data
--creating table in the database, etc.
--It maintains the consistency in case of multiple users.

# Characteristics of DBMS

+ ACID properties
  + Atomicity
  + Consistency
  + Isolation
  + Durability
+ ACID properties maintains the data in a healthy state.
---

+ Automatic backup and recovery procedures
+ Easy to manage large amounts of data
+ Handles security
+ Handles Importing/Exporting data
+ Reduce time, Improve efficency

# Disadvantages of DBMS

+ High Cost
+ Huge Size
+ Database Failure
+ Complexity
+ Performance


---
# RDBMS
  + Relational Database Management Systems
    + MySQL
    + PostgreSQL
    + MS SQL Server
    + IBM DB2
+ Table(rows & column)
   + In DBMS, the data is stored as a file, whereas in RDBMS, data is stored in the form of tables.
+  RDBMS uses SQL queries to access the data in the database.
+ Each row is a tuple.
---
![bg width:800px](./RDBMS.png)

---

# Advantages RDBMS over DBMS
+ Avoid Data Redundancy
+ RDBMS can process the complex and large amount of data.
+ Normalization of Tables
+ Modification of data is complex in DBMS while it is quite easy in RDBMS.

# ER model
+ Entity Relationship model
  + High level data model
  + It defines conceptual view of the database.
  + Database stucture is portrayed in the form of a diagram called ER diagram

---
![bg width:600px](./er1.png)

# Entity
  + object in the real wold
  + Anything which has an independent existence in the real world
  + nouns,objects,things

# Attributes
  + Describes each entity
  + Characteristics 
    + Simple- Can't be divided
    + Composite-Can be divided
    + stored

# ER Diagram
ER diagram is a graphical representation of entities and relationships in the database. 
 Following are some geometric shapes that are used to draw ER(Entity-relationship ) Diagram:
+ Rectangle: It represents the entity sets
+ Ellipses: It represents attributes
+ Diamond: It represents relationship set
+ Lines:  They link attributes to entity set and entity sets to the relationship sets
+ Double ellipses: It represents multi-valued attributes 
+ Dashed ellipses: It represents derived attributes

# ER diagram to Tables
+ Each entity becomes a table.
+ Their attributes - their column
+ Each multivalued attribute is represented by a separate table.
---
![bg width:1000px](./ertotable.png)

----
# ACID Properties
+ Atomicity:
  + It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be performed or executed completely or should not be executed at all. It further means that the operation should not break in between or execute partially. In the case of executing operations on the transaction, the operation should be completely executed and not partially.
  ----

![bg width:1000px](./atomicityNo.png)

![bg width:1000px](./atomicity.png)

----

+  Consistency: 
   + It means if a change in the database is made, it should remain preserved always. 
   + In the case of transactions, the integrity of the data is very essential so that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. The data should always be correct.

![bg width:1000px](./data_consistent.png)

-----

+ Isolation:
  + Isolation is the property of a database where no data should affect the other one and may occur concurrently
  .![bg width:1000px](./isolation.png)


----
+ Durability:
  
   + Durability ensures that the data after the successful execution of the operation becomes permanent in the database. 
   + The durability of the data should be so perfect that even if the system fails or leads to a crash, the database still survives. However, if gets lost, it becomes the responsibility of the recovery manager for ensuring the durability of the database.

# Types of Statements in SQL

+ Data Definition Language (DDL)
+ Data Query Language(DQL)
+ Data Manipulation Language (DML)

---
# Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. 
List of DDL commands: 
+ CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers).
+ DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.
+ ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.
+ TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed.
+ RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.

----
# Data Query Language(DQL)

+ DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data. It includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform operations with it.
+ List of DQL: 
	SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.

---
 # Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML.
List of DML commands: 
+ INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.
+ UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.
+ DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.

----
# Update
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
+ Syntax:

  UPDATE table_name
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...WHERE condition;
+ Example:

  UPDATE Customers
  SET ContactName='John'
  WHERE Country=‘India';

---
# Delete
The Delete statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
+ Syntax:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

+ Example:

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName=‘Preethy';


![bg width:1000px](./truncate_delete.png)


---
# MySQL Constraints

SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
+ NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
+ UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.

----
# NOT NULL
By default, a column can hold NULL values.
+ The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
+ Example
CREATE TABLE Persons (ID int NOT NULL,LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,  FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL, Age int);

----
# UNIQUE

+ The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
+ Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
+ A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
+ you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
+ Example:

CREATE TABLE Persons (ID int NOT NULL,LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,FirstName varchar(255), Age int, UNIQUE (ID));

----
# 		PRIMARY KEY
+ The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
+ Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
+ A table can have only ONE primary key;

# 			FOREIGN KEY
+ The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
+ A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
+ The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

----
# DEFAULT
+ The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
+ The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.
+ Example:

CREATE TABLE Employee (ID int NOT NULL,LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255),Age int,City varchar(255) DEFAULT ‘Bangalore');

---
# CHECK
+ The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
+ If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.
+ If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.
+ Example:

CREATE TABLE Persons ( ID int NOT NULL,LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,FirstName varchar(255),Age int, CHECK (Age>=18));

----
# Select
+ The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
+ Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name;

+ Example
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;

----
# ORDER BY
+ SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country;
+ SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country ASC;
+ SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country DESC;
+ SELECT id,name,country FROM Customers ORDER BY Country;

# WHERE 
+ SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = ‘India';
+ SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE id=3;

---
# AS
+ SELECT ID AS Cust_ID, Name AS Cust_name FROM Customers;
+ SELECT Cust_name , city AS “customer city” FROM Customers;

# DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

----
# Select with aggregate functions
An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

+ COUNT() Function
+ SUM() Function
+ AVG() Function
+ MIN() Function

----

# count
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows in a database table.
![bg width:1200px](./product_table.png)

+ SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products;

---
# SUM()
+  SUM(Price)
FROM Products;

# AVG()
+ SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;
# MIN()
+ SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;

# MAX()

+ SELECT Department, sum(Salary) as Salary FROM employee
GROUP BY department;
+ SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country;
+ SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers GROUP BY Country ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC; 


----
#   The MySQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

+ Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);

+ Example:

----
# Normalization in MySQL
+  Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
+ Normalization split a large table into smaller tables and define relationships between them to increases the clarity in organizing data.
+ The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.
+ Save storage space.

![bg width:1400px](./normal-forms-diagram.png)

----
The database normalization process is divided into following the normal form:
+ First Normal Form (1NF)
+ Second Normal Form (2NF)
+ Third Normal Form (3NF)
# First Normal Form (1NF)
+ Each column is unique in 1NF. 


![bg width:1400px](./1NF_1.jpg)

---
# Second Normal Form (2NF)
+ The entity should be considered already in 1NF.
+ All attributes within the entity should depend solely on the unique identifier of the entity.
+ No partial dependency.
